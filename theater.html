                <h3>Library in IVANOFF'S house. On the walls hang maps, pictures, guns,
                    pistols, sickles, whips, etc. A writing-table. On it lie in disorder
                    knick-knacks, papers, books, parcels, and several revolvers. Near
                    the papers stand a lamp, a decanter of vodka, and a plate of salted
                    herrings. Pieces of bread and cucumber are scattered about. SHABELSKI
                    and LEBEDIEFF are sitting at the writing-table. BORKIN is sitting
                    astride a chair in the middle of the room. PETER is standing near the
                    door.</h3>

            <p>The policy of France is clear and definite; the French know
                what they want: it is to skin those German sausages, but the Germans
                must sing another song; France is not the only thorn in their flesh.</p>

            <p>Nonsense! In my opinion the Germans are cowards and the
                French are the same. They are showing their teeth at one another, but
                you can take my word for it, they will not do more than that; they'll
                never fight!</p>

            <p>Why should they fight? Why all these congresses, this arming and
                expense? Do you know what I would do in their place? I would catch all
                the dogs in the kingdom and inoculate them with Pasteur's serum, then I
                would let them loose in the enemy's country, and the enemies would all
                go mad in a month.</p>

            <p>No, no, these cucumbers are better; every wise man since the
                creation of the world has been trying to invent something better than
                a salted cucumber, and not one has succeeded.

            Peter, go and fetch some more cucumbers. And Peter, tell the cook to make
            four little onion pasties, and see that we get them hot.</p>

                <p>Caviar is good with vodka, but it must be prepared with
                    skill. Take a quarter of a pound of pressed caviar, two little onions,
                    and a little olive oil; mix them together and put a slice of lemon on
                    top--so! Lord! The very perfume would drive you crazy!</p>
